Before every code session - DO THIS!
    -open a terminal for the project and enter the text below (minus the - )
    -got to desired branch (to keep the main branch clean)
    -git checkout (branch name)
    -git pull origin main (this pulls all the updated code from others work to you locally)
    -Happy coding

When you are finished coding - DO THIS!
    -close all servers and in the terminal enter the text below 
    -cd to main project folder (not server or client)
    -git checkout (branch name) (double check branch before continuing)
    -git add .   (there is a space between the "add" and the ".")(the dot means ALL)
